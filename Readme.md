# ‚≠ê Plant-Disease-Detection & Fertilizer Suggestion using CNN
* Plant Disease is necessary for every farmer so we are created Plant disease detection using Deep learning. In which we are using Convoluitona neural Netowork for classifying Leaf images into 39 Different Categories. The Convolutional Neural Code build in Pytorch Framework. For Training we are using Plant village dataset.

## ‚≠êTesting Images

* If you do not have leaf images then you can use test images located in test_images folder
* Each Image have it's disease name so you can verify model is working perfact or not.
